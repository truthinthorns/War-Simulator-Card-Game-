This "simulator" figures out who should win a game of War, either based on a real deal, or a random one. If it's a real one, the user enters the cards each player has, and it will run through the game and decide who would win. If it's a random one, it does the same thing, except the user doesn't have to enter any cards.

One potential flaw:
  When a player wins a bout, the losing player's card(s) are added to the back of the winning player's deck first, then the winning player adds their cards to the back of their own deck. This SHOULD be the only thing that's wrong/could give different results than a real game that I can see.
